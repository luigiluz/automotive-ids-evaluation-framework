## Introduction

This repository contains some of the efforts of the CIn-UFPE Connected Systems Lab
on developing new Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for Automotive Ethernet networks.

The main idea of this repository is to contain the code of our work and also the reproduction
code of other related work to automotive Ethernet intrusion detection. Therefore, the scripts
were constructed to be easily extensible to include new datasets and IDSs that are based
on Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

This repository currently contains the code to reproduce the following work:

- [Multi-Stage Deep Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System for Automotive Ethernet Network](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4658006)
- [Convolutional neural network-based intrusion detection system for AVTP streams in automotive Ethernet-based networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214209621000073)

## Getting started

The first step is to prepare the python virtual environment with the necessary libraries. We have prepared a Makefile to help with this setup, to prepare the environment, simply run:

```console
make bootstrap
```

Once you have the libraries properly installed in the virtual environment, the next step is to activate the virtual environment. To do so, run the following command:

```console
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virutal environment is properly activated, we can move on to use our entrypoint scripts. We have the following entrypoint scripts:

- execute_feature_generator.py
- execute_model_train_validation.py
- execute_model_test.py

Each script uses as input a json configuration file that contain the information necessary for the script execution. The script output depends on the script, but it can vary from data in different formats and trained models to be further used in other scenarios.

These scripts should be ideally executed sequentially with the output of the previous scripts. They were kept separated to ease the experimentation of different kind of parameters that do not require changes in the other scripts.

The overall interaction between the scripts is presented in the following image:

In the following subsections we will present a simple use of each script.

### Executing the feature generator script

The main purpose of the feature generator script is to transform raw input data into meaningful features according to the feature generation specification. To execute the feature generator script with a sample input file called feat_gen_config.json, simply run:

```console
python3 execute_feature_generator.py --feat_gen_config feat_gen_config.json
```

The content of feat_gen_config.json could be:
```json
feat_gen_config.json
{
    "feature_generator": "CNNIDSFeatureGenerator",
    "config": {
        "window_size": 44,
        "window_slide": 1,
        "number_of_bytes": 58,
        "multiclass": false,
        "labeling_schema": "AVTP_Intrusion_dataset",
        "dataset": "AVTP_Intrusion_dataset",
        "suffix": "test",
        "sum_x": true
    },
    "paths": {
        "injected_only_frame_path": "/path/to/file",
        "injected_data_paths" : ["/path/to/file1", "path/to/file2"],
        "output_path": "/output/path"
    }
```

The output artifacts will be placed in the specific output path.

**__NOTE:__** It is important to mention that the name of the generated output files may differ from the ones that are under "config_jsons" folder. For this reason, it will be necessary to update your configuration json to match the name of your own output files.

#### Feature generator json file parameters

This section intends to describe the parameters available in the "feat_gen_config.json" file:

- feature_generator: This option selects the type of the feature generator. Available options: ["CNNIDSFeatureGenerator"];
- config: window_size: The number of packets to be aggregated in a window;
- config: window_slide: The number of samples to move forward to aggregate new packets;
- config: number_of_bytes: The number of bytes considered for each packet. In case where the packet has less than the specified value, zero padding will be applied;
- config: multiclass: Selects. Available options: [true, false]
- config: labeling_schema: This selects how the raw label column will be used to generate. Available options: ["AVTP_Intrusion_dataset", "TOW_IDS_dataset_one_class", "TOW_IDS_dataset_multi_class"]
- config: dataset: Informs the dataset. Available options: ["AVTP_Intrusion_dataset", "TOW_IDS_dataset"]
- config: suffix: Determine the suffix that will be inserted in feature generator output file. This is only used for debug and versioning purposes.
- config: sum_x: Selects if the features will be aggregated along the x axis with a sum operation. Available options: [true, false].

In order to make our results more reproducible, the following subsections specifies the feature generator configs used in our experiments:

##### AVTP dataset

            "learning_rate": 0.001,
            "num_epochs": 1,
            "early_stopping_patience": 5,
            "num_outputs": 6
        },
        "paths": {
            "metrics_output_path":"/path/to/metric/output",
            "models_output_path":"/path/to/model/output"
        },
        "presaved_paths": {
            "0": "/path/to/model/trained/in/fold/0",
            "1": "/path/to/model/trained/in/fold/1",
            "2": "/path/to/model/trained/in/fold/2",
            "3": "/path/to/model/trained/in/fold/3",
            "4": "/path/to/model/trained/in/fold/4"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Running only for timing measurements

It is important to notice that when you are focusing on only timing measurements to evaluate the detection time, it is not necessary to load the entire dataset, as it would delay the measurements and difficult experimentation.

For this reason, we have provided the "sample_inputs/" folder, that contains smaller samples from the test data that are loaded as fast as possible. To use this files, we have also provided some sample configs that are under "config_jsons/test_detection_time". Please keep in mind that the accuracy related metrics generated with the samples files are not reliable, as the input dataset is only a small subset of all data.
